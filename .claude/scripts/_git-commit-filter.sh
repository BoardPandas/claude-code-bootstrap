#                      that needs a VALUE back out.
#   tokenize_command   preserves the contents of quoted regions, so `cd "/a b"`
#                      yields the path. Correspondingly more expensive: it is a
#                      character walk, so callers reach for it only when the
#                      cheap view says there is something to resolve.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quoted regions collapse to ONE opaque token rather than being deleted.
# Deleting them looks equivalent and is not: `git -C "/path with space" commit`
# would become `git -C  commit`, and the -C would then swallow the word
# `commit` as its own value -- a commit that reports itself as not a commit.
#
# Newlines become separators, so the second line of a two-line script is still

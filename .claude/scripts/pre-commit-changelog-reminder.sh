=== CHANGELOG & VERSION UPDATE REQUIRED ===

You are about to commit, but the changelog contract is not satisfied yet. The
next hook will block this command. Before committing, you MUST:

1. Review what you are shipping: git diff --cached --stat
2. Add a new section at the TOP of CHANGELOG.md, in Keep a Changelog form:

     ## [<new version>] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

     ### Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed / Security
     - Entries written from the user's perspective, not implementation details.

3. Bump version in package.json to that same version (Major.Minor.Patch,
   every commit bumps at least Patch):
   - Patch: bug fixes, security patches, perf improvements, docs, refactors, config, chores
   - Minor: new features or enhancements
   - Major: NEVER bump autonomously -- ask user first
4. Stage both: git add CHANGELOG.md package.json
5. Then retry the commit.

The version in CHANGELOG.md and the version in package.json must match.
Make these edits as their own step -- a PreToolUse hook cannot see files that
the very command it is checking has not written yet.

For a genuinely trivial commit, prefix the command itself:
   SKIP_CHANGELOG=1 git commit -m "..."

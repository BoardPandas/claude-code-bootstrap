# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash, if: Bash(git commit*)).
# Enforces the changelog-and-version contract in .claude/rules/commit-changelog.md.

# Exit 0 = allow. Exit 2 = block.
#
# A blocking hook's STDOUT IS DISCARDED -- the message must go to stderr or the
# user gets a refused command with no reason attached. That is what happened
# here for every block until 2026-07-29; the harness reported literally
# "No stderr output". (LL-G kb/claude-code/hook-empty-path-formats-repo.md)
#
# Three checks, all on STATE rather than on the command's text (see the long
# comment in _git-commit-filter.sh for why that distinction is the whole point):
#   1. CHANGELOG.md differs from HEAD.
#   2. package.json's version differs from HEAD's.
#   3. CHANGELOG.md contains a "## [<version>]" section for that version.
#
# Check 3 is what makes 1 and 2 more than theatre: an edit that landed in the
# wrong place satisfies 1, and a bump with no entry satisfies 2.
#
# Escape hatches (exit 0 without requiring anything):
#   - Merge commits (MERGE_HEAD exists) -- the merged branches carry their own entries.
#   - git commit --amend -- the commit being rewritten already carried its entry.
#   - The initial commit -- there is no HEAD to diff against.
#   - SKIP_CHANGELOG=1 in the environment -- for reverts, hotfixes, trivial commits.
#
# In a repo with no package.json the version checks self-disable and this
# degrades to check 1, because a gate that blocks every commit in a non-Node repo
# is a gate that gets deleted.

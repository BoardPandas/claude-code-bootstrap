# The matcher is the bare tool name. "Bash(git commit*)" is permissions syntax;
# in a matcher it matches nothing and the hook never runs.

# Blocks git commit commands that contain PowerShell here-string syntax.
# In the Bash tool, @'...'@ is NOT a here-string: the @ characters are
# literal and leak into the commit message as a stray @ line (the commit
# subject becomes a bare "@").
#
# Correct approach: write the message to a file OUTSIDE .git/ (the settings
# deny Edit(**/.git/**), so the Write tool cannot create it there) -- e.g. the
# session scratchpad -- then run: git commit -F <that file>
# With no scratchpad, use a self-ignoring .agent-scratch/ at the repo root. Not
# a mktemp path: outside the working tree, Write is refused in acceptEdits and
# non-interactive runs, as it is under .claude/ (a protected path).
#
# Exit 0 = allow. Exit 2 = block (stderr is shown to Claude).

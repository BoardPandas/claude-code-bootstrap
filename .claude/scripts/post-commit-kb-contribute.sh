Review the work you just committed and evaluate:

1. LL-G (Lessons Learned / Gotchas) -- wellforce-brandon/LL-G
   Did you discover any gotchas, silent failures, or non-obvious behaviors?
   Did you hit a bug that wasted time and others should know about?
   If YES: ask the user if they'd like to run /add-lesson to contribute it.

2. BP (Best Practices) -- wellforce-brandon/BP
   Did you establish a new proven pattern worth replicating across repos?
   Did you implement something that took research to get right?
   If YES: ask the user if they'd like to run /add-practice to contribute it.

If nothing is worth contributing, say nothing -- do not clutter the output.
Only surface this if you genuinely identified something valuable.
